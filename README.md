Tic-Tac-Toe-JS
==============

Authored solely by: Samee Zahid

Built using HTML tables, the user must click on the box where he/she wants to mark their move.
The game has two modes:

1) Single-Player

A very basic AI which uses the random function on unmarked boxes to figure out where to place its move.

2) Multiplayer

Users take alternating turns until a victor is decided, or the game is adjudged to be a draw.

I've used CSS3 to use rudimentary animations for my mode.html page (where a user chooses the mode). I might return to this in the future to improve the AI for single-player.
